I just want to say that Flatiron has been a blast. I have learned so much about becoming a full stack developer. I would definitely recommend this bootcamp to anyone that wants to become a software engineer. Having choosing the self-paced program has given me the oppurtunity to also work a part-time job. The entire course was flexible to where i can work on flatiron whenever I would need to. I will most defiently be looking into other flatiron courses if i do decide to further out my education in computer programming.
