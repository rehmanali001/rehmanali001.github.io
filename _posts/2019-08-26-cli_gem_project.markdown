My CLI Gem project was pretty tough considering that I had been struggling with object oriented ruby for a long time, but after long days and nights of researching and using external resources, I had finally finished my project. My project basically consists a user who can interact with the terminal and choose IMDB's top 50 movies and get information about each movie. The most difficult part about my project was where to begin. I knew that I had to scrape a website so i began with that after I had figured out which website I wanted to use. I also knew that I had to introduce class and instance methods, so i moved on to that next. Lastly, it was just calling all of my code into one ruby file whic had all my code that was going to be sent to the terminal. I did struggle trying to scape a link that was one level deep, but there was a problem with IMDB's website, so I decided to just scrape the index page rather. After cleaning up all uncessary codes, I had completed my project. If it wasn't for all the walkthorughs and videos explaing how to set up your own gem, I would still be stuck on the first part of my project. I guess in the end I can say that I'm pretty comfortable with ruby, and am excited to see what's next!
