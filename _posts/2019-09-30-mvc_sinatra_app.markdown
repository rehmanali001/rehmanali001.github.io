Just finished my MVC Sinatra App and I can say that developing this app has been exciting. I had trouble at first trying to build the foundation of the app, which I can say is what most people struggle with, but once I had that figured out the rest was a breeze. Coming up with an idea of what you want to make can be difficult and took me a while till I finally figured out what I wanted to create. To me the hardest part to when it comes to creating this app is the html portion. It's hard to make everything to look nice and pretty and exactly how you want it to be. The singing up and loggin in part was the easiest to make, but once you involve another model to tie that with it, it gets tough. I also had issues with using vs code, not being able to rack-flash to challenge myself even further, but I eventually got it to work learn ide. In the end I can deffinitely say that Sinatra is one interesting framework, I only hope that rails is much smoother and consistent than Sinatra.
