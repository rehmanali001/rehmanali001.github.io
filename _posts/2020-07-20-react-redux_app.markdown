Finally, after all countless hours of reviewing and practicing, I have completed my last React project! First and foremost, this section was by far the most fun i've had while bulding an application. Putting together everything from backend to the frontend has been a real challenege. Working with both react and redux has giving a me a real good understanding of how easily the frontend can manipulated. Although, I did run into many issues, but having worked dynamically rather than vertically has really shown me that patience is really the key to building out the perfect web applications. There were times when I wanted to skip ahead but knowing that I would get issues, I stopped and thought to myself that I need to code this application piece by piece. I will definitely further my knowledge in react-redux as well as ruby on rails. It really has been a pleasure learning to become a full stack web developer at flatiron.
