This rails app was by the far the most fun i've had coding. After finishing the sinatra section, rails came really easy and not too difficult. Even though I wanted to use my sinatra project and apply rails, I ended up creating a new project for rails. I figured it'll help me write new code rather than copying and pasting.  I did have trouble with associations and validations which I went back and brushed up on that lesson. I will definitely be going back through the old curriculums just so I can refresh my brain and practice to get better. I'm definitely proud of this project and defintiely forward to the last two projects!
