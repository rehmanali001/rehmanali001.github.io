This project was easily my favorite in terms of fully developing a JS and Rails Project. I really enjoyed learning how the front end process of a webpage works. Javascript is a really fun and interesting language, I never knew that you can manipulate the HTML (aka the DOM) and add elements to the page. That's what made building a webiste more exciting. My project was tough since I ran into many issues with fetch get and post methods, but eventually ended up figuring it out. Bulding out a single page for me in my opinion was more tough than building a multiple page application, I struggled a lot trying to hide elements and only show what I wanted to show. I can definitely say that i'm really familiar and comfortable building out front end and back end websites. I can only wait to see what react has for me next.
